It is the mega version of Pixel – Responsive Bootstrap Navbar. If you want the normal version go and get it. It is a custom bootstrap mega menu. I have added shopping cart section and logo to make it more attractive. Logo and search box pull center on small screens.
In the 2nd update, I have added a new model to the menu: Mega / normal header and navigation

#### Features:
+ Header and navigation model new
